                <p>
                    I am a second year Computer Science student with a passion for learning and a determination for building cool stuff! 
                    I am currently learning how to combine different web technologies to create my first porfolio website.
                    I am learning how to use Git and GitHub so that I can be like the cool, advanced and working coders who value teamwork and version control.
                    Each week I get together with friends and we work on projects together.
                    I recently did a hackathon where my Team and I couldn't even get started which ignited an even greater fire inn us to learn how to use these more practical tools that our degree hadn't taught us yet.
                    i belive in doing things that matter and these are some of them!!!!!
